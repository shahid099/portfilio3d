- To use EmailJS for the contact form functionality, create a `.env` file in the
  project folder after forking or cloning the project. This file will contain
  your keys, also known as environment variables.

- Add the following to your `.env` file:

```
VITE_EMAIL_SERVICE_ID = "Your Email Service key without double quotes (Quotes are just to grab your attention)."

VITE_EMAIL_TEMPLET_ID = "Your Email Template key without double quotes (Quotes are just to grab your attention)."

VITE_EMAIL_USER_ID = "Your Email User ID without double quotes (Quotes are just to grab your attention)."
```

- Open the terminal at the directory where you have the project and run `npm
install` to download all the necessary dependencies

- Now run `npm run dev` to open the local environment

- Feel free to use it or make any necessary modifications `:D`
